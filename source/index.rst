Welcome to USP Digital Urban - Python GIS
=========================================

This lesson is a quick introductory tour that aims to demonstrate how to use Python programming language for automating
common GIS tasks. The examples that you will see are based on teaching materials from `Geo-Python <https://geo-python.github.io>`__ and `Automating GIS processes <https://autogis.github.io>`__
-courses that are introductory courses (5 credits) to Python programming and using Python for GIS. Those courses are altogether 14 weeks,
so during this 3 hour lesson we will only touch the surface of what can be done with programming and why is it useful to know how to program.

Learning goals
--------------

- Understand why it is good to know at least the basics of programming
- Know some of the basic concepts in programming (e.g. variables, loops, conditional statements)
- Know how programming can be used to do GIS and spatial analysis (read/write spatial data)
- Know where to look for more information and start learning yourself

Topics
------

The materials that we touch upon today are divided into following themes:

  - `Why to learn how to program? <_static/USP_Introduction_to_programming.pdf>`__
     - See also, e.g. article in `The Conversation about Why everyone should learn computer programming <http://theconversation.com/why-everyone-should-have-to-learn-computer-programming-62328>`__
  - :doc:`How to start and install Python? <course-info/Installing_Anacondas_GIS>`
  - `Doing GIS in Python <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/lessons/L1/Intro-Python-GIS.html>`__
  - `Introduction to Geopandas <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/lessons/L2/geopandas-basics.html>`__
  - `Python programming with QGIS 3.0 (processing -module) <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/lessons/L6/01-overview.html>`__

If you are eager to learn more, there are more materials (with videos) available from `Geo-Python <https://geo-python.github.io>`__ and `Automating GIS processes <http://autogis.github.io>`__ -course sites.

If you want to have access to the `cloud computing environment <https://geo-python.github.io/2017/lessons/L1/course-environment-components.html#cloud-computing-environment>`__ where you can really easily start to test all the Python GIS examples you have seen (all necessary softwares are readily installed),
please contact Henrikki (see :doc:`here <course-info/course-info>`).

Exercise
--------

The exercise for this week is a short and fun introduction to Python programming using easy to use online learning environment provided by **DataCamp**.
You need to register yourself to `DataCamp <https://www.datacamp.com>`__ (sign up easily e.g. with email or Facebook) and start a Track
`Intro to Python for Data Science <https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science>`__.

From the **Intro to Python for Data Science** -track you should finish the first 3 chapters (i.e. do the exercises):

  1. Python basics
  2. Python lists
  3. Functions and Packages

Going through these chapters should take approximately 3 hours. Once you have finished those chapters, you should send me (via email)
a screenshot showing that you have finished those exercises, such as the one below:
